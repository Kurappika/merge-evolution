## Description

Merge Evolution is a puzzle game where players place tiles on a grid. When three or more identical tiles are connected orthogonally (up, down, left, or right), they merge into a single, upgraded tile at the position where the last tile was placed. The goal is to plan your moves carefully to create massive chain reactions, achieve the highest-level tile possible, and get the highest score before the board fills up!
